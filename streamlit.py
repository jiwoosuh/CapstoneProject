    This capstone seeks to digitize the financial processes of the Women Affinity
    Groups (WAGs) under the Nigeria for Women Program Scale Up (NFWP-SU)
    project. By structuring digitized financial transaction data, this will improve the efficiency for WAGs to
    harness technology for savings, credit access, and overall economic empowerment
    in order to help low-income women.

    ## 2. Background and Context
    st.subheader("2. Background and Context")
    st.markdown("""
    WAGs have been pivotal in fostering women's financial and social capital in
    Nigeria. They provide a platform for savings, mutual lending, and skill
    development. Despite their success, these groups face challenges in manual
    financial transactions, which are time-consuming and prone to errors. The
    digitization of these groups promises to streamline operations and expand their
    impact.

    st.subheader("3. Problem Description")
    st.markdown("""
    The project addresses the need for an efficient, transparent, and scalable solution to
    manage the financial activities of WAGs. By digitizing financial process, the
    project aims to automate savings, loan repayments, and other financial
    transactions, thereby enhancing the operational efficiency and financial
    empowerment of the groups.

    - Digitize unstructured raw data into analyzable data.
    - Develop a dashboard to visualize financial transactions for further insights.
    - Measure the impact of digitization on the efficiency of WAGs and the economic
